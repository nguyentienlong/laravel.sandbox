Feature: weather indicator
  In order to get weather information
  As a user
  I want to get a human readable version of xml weather forcast

  Scenario:
    Given xml input "<some>strange</parsing error>"
    When I run my application
    Then I should get an exception with message "service currently not available"

  Scenario:
    Given xml input "<weather><cloud>0</cloud><temperature>-10</temperature><rain>0</rain></weather>"
    When I run my application
    Then I should get no error
    But I should be able to get weather information

  Scenario Outline:
    Given value <cloud> for clouds
    When I call cloudiness
    Then I should get cloudiness <cloudiness>

  Examples:
    | cloud | cloudiness    |
    | 0     | bright        |
    | 20    | partly cloudy |
    | 50    | cloudy        |
    | 90    | clouded       |

  Scenario:
    Given value 20 for clouds
    And value 27 for temperature
    And value 0 for rain
    When I call summary
    Then I should get summary "a beautiful warm day"
